### Fig 5: Design Pattern of Booking Services

- **Observer Pattern**: ValueEventListener acts as an observer that listens for changes in the database (DatabaseReference). Both Booking_information_show and Book_services are observers subscribing to changes in the database.
- **Singleton Pattern**: FirebaseDatabase is used as a singleton to ensure there is only one instance of the database throughout the application.
- **Proxy Pattern**: The relationship between ValueEventListener and DatabaseReference acts as a proxy to the actual database reference, providing a level of indirection and control over access to the database.

## Continuous Integration

Continuous integration (CI) is a development practice that involves automatically testing and validating code changes as they are integrated into a shared repository. The CI process for this app involves the following steps:

1. **Automated Testing**: Every code change is automatically tested using a suite of unit tests, UI tests, and integration tests. This ensures that new changes do not introduce any errors or bugs into the codebase.
2. **Build Automation**: The app is automatically built and compiled whenever new code is pushed to the repository. This helps identify any build issues early in the development process.
3. **Code Review and Quality Checks**: Automated tools are used to perform code reviews and quality checks, ensuring that the code meets the project's standards and guidelines.
4. **Deployment**: Once the code changes pass all tests and quality checks, the app is automatically deployed to a staging environment for further testing and validation. If everything is in order, the app is then deployed to the production environment.

By implementing continuous integration, the development team can quickly identify and address any issues, ensuring a smooth and efficient development process.
